## 🎯 Example Output

When you click "Ask ChatGPT", you get something like:

```
🤖💡 ChatGPT Suggests

Best Move: 3-1→4-1

Explanation: This move advances your square piece forward, 
putting pressure on Black's position while maintaining good 
center control. It threatens to capture Black's circle on 
the next turn if not defended.

Alternative: Consider 3-0→3-1 to advance your rhombus, 
but only if your base is well-defended.

Material Evaluation: Even (0 points)
Position: Slight advantage to White
```
