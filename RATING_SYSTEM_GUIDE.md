# 🏆 ROMGON Rating System Guide

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented

---

## 📊 Overview

The ROMGON Rating System uses the **ELO Rating Algorithm**, a well-established mathematical formula used in chess to calculate player strength and skill progression. This system provides fair competition matching and meaningful skill progression tracking.

---

## 🎓 Understanding ELO Ratings

### What is ELO?
ELO is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. The name comes from Arpad Elo, who invented the system for chess. It's now used in many competitive games and sports.

### Core Formula
```
New Rating = Old Rating + K × (Score - Expected Score)

Where:
- K = volatility factor (32 in ROMGON)
- Score = 1 for win, 0 for loss
- Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent rating - your rating) / 400))
```

### What This Means
- **Beating a higher-rated opponent** = more points gained
- **Losing to a lower-rated opponent** = more points lost
- **Beating a lower-rated opponent** = fewer points gained
- **Losing to a higher-rated opponent** = fewer points lost

---

## 🎯 ROMGON Rating System Details

### Initial Rating
- **Starting Rating**: 1600 for all new players
- **Rationale**: Mid-range starting point allows for natural progression up or down
- **First Game Impact**: First game can adjust rating up to ~32 points

### K-Factor
- **Value**: 32 (standard for competitive play)
- **What It Controls**: Rating volatility/change per game
- **Impact**: Average rating change per game is ±8 to ±32 points

### Opponent Ratings
Players can compete against:
- **AI**: Default rating 1600 (balanced)
- **AI_Easy**: Rating 1200 (beginner AI)
- **AI_Medium**: Rating 1600 (intermediate AI)
- **AI_Hard**: Rating 2000 (strong AI)
- **AI_Expert**: Rating 2400 (master-level AI)
- **Players**: Any registered user's current rating
