# AI EXTREME Rebalancing - Stop Rhombus Dominance

**Date:** October 21, 2025 12:47 PM  
**Issue:** AI still only playing rhombus despite previous balance attempts  
**Solution:** EXTREME scoring adjustments + rhombus penalties + detailed debug logging

## 🔴 Changes Made (EXTREME Edition)

### Rhombus Scoring - NUKED:

| Mechanic | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Distance to goal | `(20-dist) × 8` | `(20-dist) × 2` | ⬇️ **-75%** |
| Row 3 bonus | +25 | +5 | ⬇️ **-80%** |
| Mobility bonus | +20/move | +8/move | ⬇️ **-60%** |

**NEW: Rhombus Penalty**
- **-50 points** when moving rhombus with 3+ tactical pieces available
- Forces AI to use army instead of solo rhombus push

### Non-Rhombus Bonuses - MASSIVELY BOOSTED:

| Mechanic | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Diversity bonus | +40 | **+80** | ⬆️ **+100%** |
| Army bonus (4+ pieces) | +30 | **+60** | ⬆️ **+100%** |
| **TOTAL NON-RHOMBUS** | +70 | **+140** | ⬆️ **+100%** |

### Capture Values - DOMINANT:

| Piece | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Triangle | **300** 🔥 |
| Hexagon | **280** 🔥 |
| Circle | **260** 🔥 |
| Square | **240** 🔥 |

### Tactical Scoring:

- Threatening pieces: **80 points each**
- Threatening enemy rhombus: **800 points** 🎯
- Escaping danger: **300 points**

## 📊 New Scoring Breakdown

### Rhombus Move (Non-capture):
```
Base advancement:  (20-10) × 2 = 20 points
Row 3 bonus:       5 points
Mobility (3 moves): 3 × 8 = 24 points
PENALTY (has army): -50 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             -1 to 49 points MAX
```

### Square Move (Non-capture with threat):
```
Diversity bonus:    80 points
Army bonus:         60 points (if 4+ pieces)
Threatening 1 piece: 80 points
Forward movement:   8 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             228 points
```

### Triangle Capture:
```
Capture triangle:   300 points 🔥
Diversity bonus:    80 points
Army bonus:         60 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             440 points
```

**Result:** Tactical pieces should DOMINATE scoring!

## 🔍 Debug Logging Added

The AI now logs comprehensive decision analysis:

### 1. Piece Type Distribution:
```
📊 AI Move Analysis:
  Top 10 moves by piece type: {square: 4, triangle: 3, rhombus: 2, circle: 1}
```

### 2. Best Move Per Piece Type:
```
🎯 Best move for each piece type:
  square: 3-1 → 3-2 | Score: 228.5 | Total: 250.3
  triangle: 2-2 → 3-3 | Score: 440.2 | Total: 465.8 (CAPTURE)
  rhombus: 3-0 → 3-1 | Score: 35.1 | Total: 45.2
```

### 3. Top 5 Moves Overall:
```
🏆 Top 5 moves overall:
  1. triangle 2-2 → 3-3 ⚔️CAPTURE | Score: 440.2, Total: 465.8
  2. square 3-1 → 4-2 | Score: 248.3, Total: 270.1
  3. hexgon 2-3 → 3-4 | Score: 220.5, Total: 235.7
  4. rhombus 3-0 → 3-1 | Score: 35.1, Total: 45.2
```

### 4. Diversity Bonus Tracking:
```
✨ DIVERSITY BONUS: square at 3-1 gets +140 points
✨ DIVERSITY BONUS: triangle at 2-2 gets +140 points
⚠️ RHOMBUS PENALTY: Using rhombus when 5 tactical pieces available
```

## 🎮 Expected Behavior NOW:

✅ **Squares, Triangles, Hexagons, Circles** should dominate top moves  
✅ **Captures** should be top priority (240-300 points base)  
✅ **Creating threats** should be highly valued (80+ points)  
✅ **Rhombus** should only move when:
  - It's the winning move
  - It can capture
  - It's escaping danger
  - No tactical pieces available

❌ **Rhombus** should NOT dominate with simple advancement moves

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

1. **Open Console** (F12) - You'll see detailed AI decision logs
2. **Start New AI Game**
3. **Watch the logs:**
   - Look for `📊 AI Move Analysis` - should show variety
   - Look for `🎯 Best move for each piece type` - rhombus should score LOW
   - Look for `✨ DIVERSITY BONUS` messages
   - Look for `⚠️ RHOMBUS PENALTY` messages

4. **What to expect:**
   - AI should move squares, triangles, circles, hexagons
   - AI should actively hunt for captures
   - AI should create threats against your pieces
   - Rhombus should stay back until needed

---

## 📈 Score Comparison:

### Before (Rhombus Dominant):
- Rhombus advancement: ~160 points
- Captures: 200 points
- Tactical play: Not competitive

### After (Tactical Dominant):
- Rhombus advancement: ~20-49 points (or NEGATIVE with penalty)
- Captures: 300-440 points 🔥
- Tactical threats: 220+ points 🔥
- Diversity bonus: +140 points 🔥

**Rhombus is now 5-10x LESS attractive than tactical play!**

---

## 🔧 If AI Still Plays Only Rhombus...

Check console logs and report:
1. What does `📊 AI Move Analysis` show?
2. What are the actual scores in `🎯 Best move for each piece type`?
3. Are there any error messages?

This will help identify if:
- Rhombus scoring is still too high
- Diversity bonus not being applied correctly
- No good tactical moves available (unlikely with +140 base bonus)
