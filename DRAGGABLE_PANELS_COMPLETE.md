## 📋 Technical Details

### Code Structure

#### **1. Sandbox Panel Modifications**

**HTML Changes (lines 10695-10778):**
```html
<div id="sandbox-tools-panel" style="
    display: none; 
    position: fixed; 
    top: 80px; 
    left: 20px;
    padding: 0;  /* Changed from 20px */
    resize: both;  /* NEW */
    overflow: auto;  /* NEW */
    max-width: 320px;  /* NEW */
    ...
">
    <!-- NEW Draggable Header -->
    <div class="sandbox-panel-header" style="
        cursor: move; 
        padding: 15px 20px; 
        background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
        user-select: none;
    ">
        <h3>Sandbox Mode</h3>
        <p>Position Editor (Drag to Move)</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Content Wrapper -->
    <div style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 15px;">
        <!-- All controls go here -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**JavaScript (lines 24960-25047):**
- `initializeSandboxDraggable()` - Sets up drag listeners
- `mousemove` handler - Updates panel position
- `mouseup` handler - Saves position to localStorage
- Wraps `startSandboxMode()` to auto-initialize

#### **2. Camera Panel Modifications**

**HTML Changes (lines 12800-12893):**
```html
<div id="camera-panel" style="
    position: fixed;
    padding: 0;  /* Changed from 15px */
    resize: both;  /* NEW */
    overflow: auto;  /* NEW */
    max-width: 400px;  /* NEW */
    ...
">
    <!-- NEW Draggable Header -->
    <div class="camera-panel-header" style="
        cursor: move;
        padding: 12px 15px;
        background: rgba(78, 205, 196, 0.1);
        user-select: none;
    ">
        <div>🎥 3D Camera (Drag to Move)</div>
        <button onclick="closeCameraPanel()">✕</button>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Content Wrapper -->
    <div style="padding: 15px;">
        <!-- All camera controls -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**JavaScript (lines 25051-25149):**
- `initializeCameraDraggable()` - Sets up drag listeners
- Smart header detection (ignores close button clicks)
- Clears `bottom/right` positioning when dragged
- Wraps `toggleCamera3D()` to auto-initialize

## 🔧 How It Works

### Drag System Architecture

```
User clicks header
      ↓
mousedown event fires
      ↓
Store panel + offset
      ↓
mousemove tracks position
      ↓
Calculate bounded position
      ↓
Update panel left/top
      ↓
mouseup saves to localStorage
```

### Key Variables

**Sandbox Panel:**
- `draggedSandboxPanel` - Currently dragged element
- `sandboxDragOffsetX/Y` - Mouse offset from panel corner
- localStorage key: `'sandboxPanelPosition'`

**Camera Panel:**
- `draggedCameraPanel` - Currently dragged element
- `cameraDragOffsetX/Y` - Mouse offset from panel corner
- localStorage key: `'cameraPanelPosition'`

**Eliminated Panels:**
- `draggedPanel` - Currently dragged element (existing)
- `dragOffsetX/Y` - Mouse offset (existing)
- localStorage key: `'eliminatedPanel0Position'`, `'eliminatedPanel1Position'`

### Boundary Detection
```javascript
const maxX = window.innerWidth - panel.offsetWidth;
const maxY = window.innerHeight - panel.offsetHeight;
const boundedLeft = Math.max(0, Math.min(newLeft, maxX));
const boundedTop = Math.max(0, Math.min(newTop, maxY));
```

Prevents panels from going off-screen.

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### During Drag
- **Opacity:** Changes to `0.8` (semi-transparent)
- **Cursor:** Shows `move` cursor on header
- **Smooth Movement:** Real-time position updates

### Header Styling
- **User-select: none** - Prevents text selection while dragging
- **Cursor: move** - Indicates draggable area
- **Background:** Slightly darker than panel content

---

## 💾 Persistence

### localStorage Schema

**Sandbox Panel Position:**
```json
{
  "left": "120px",
  "top": "150px"
}
```

**Camera Panel Position:**
```json
{
  "left": "500px",
  "top": "200px",
  "bottom": "auto",
  "right": "auto"
}
```

**Eliminated Panels:**
```json
// eliminatedPanel0Position
{
  "left": "20px",
  "top": "100px"
}

// eliminatedPanel1Position  
{
  "left": "20px",
  "top": "450px"
}
```

### Persistence Behavior
- Position saved on drag end (`mouseup`)
- Loaded on panel initialization
- Survives page refresh
- Per-browser storage (not synced across devices)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### 1. Mobile/Touch Support
**Issue:** Drag system uses `mousedown/mousemove/mouseup` events only  
**Impact:** Won't work on touch devices  
**Workaround:** Would need `touchstart/touchmove/touchend` handlers

### 2. Resize Handle Visibility
**Issue:** CSS `resize: both` uses native browser handle (subtle)  
**Impact:** Users might not notice resize capability  
**Improvement:** Could add custom resize handle in corner

### 3. Panel Overlap
**Issue:** Panels can overlap each other when dragged  
**Impact:** Readability issues if panels stack  
**Workaround:** Users can drag panels to separate positions

### 4. Off-Screen Recovery
**Issue:** If viewport resizes smaller, saved position might be off-screen  
**Current Behavior:** Boundary detection keeps it visible  
**Could Improve:** Reset to default if position invalid

### Troubleshooting

**Panel won't drag:**
- Check that you're clicking the header (colored bar at top)
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page

**Panel position not saving:**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Try incognito mode to test
- Clear cache and reload

**Panel stuck off-screen:**
- Clear localStorage for that panel
- Boundary detection should prevent this

**Resize not working:**
- Ensure you're dragging from bottom-right corner
- Some browsers have subtle resize handles
- Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
