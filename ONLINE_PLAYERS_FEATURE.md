## Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`deploy/index.html`)

#### 1. **HTML Structure** (Line ~4240)
Added online players section at top of lobby:

```html
<!-- Online Players Section -->
<div style="...">
    <div>
        <div style="...">
            <!-- Pulsing green dot -->
            <div style="
                width: 10px;
                height: 10px;
                border-radius: 50%;
                background: #4ecdc4;
                box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(78, 205, 196, 0.6);
                animation: pulse 2s infinite;
            "></div>
            <span style="color: #4ecdc4;">
                <span id="online-players-count">0</span> Players Online
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="online-players-list" style="...">
        <!-- Players will be added dynamically -->
        <span style="color: #888;">Connecting...</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. **CSS Animation** (Line ~2895)
Added pulse animation for online indicator:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
    50% { opacity: 0.5; }
}
```

#### 3. **JavaScript Functions** (Line ~13000)

**`initializeOnlinePlayers()`**
- Sets up WebSocket listeners
- Handles `lobby:onlinePlayers` event (initial list)
- Handles `lobby:playerJoined` event (new player)
- Handles `lobby:playerLeft` event (player disconnected)
- Requests initial players list on connect

**`updateOnlinePlayersList(players)`**
- Clears current list
- Populates with new player array
- Triggers render

**`renderOnlinePlayers()`**
- Updates player count
- Filters out current user
- Shows max 10 players
- Renders player cards with:
  - Status dot (green/gold)
  - Username
  - Rating
  - Click handler for challenge
- Shows "+X more" if over 10 players

**`challengePlayer(userId)`**
- Placeholder for challenge system
- Shows alert with player ID
- TODO: Implement actual challenge

#### 4. **WebSocket Authentication** (Line ~12950)
Enhanced socket connection to send user info:

```javascript
gameSocket = io(`${BACKEND_API_URL}/game`, {
    auth: {
        token: localStorage.getItem('token'),
        userId: userId,
        username: username,
        rating: rating
    },
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});
```

---

### Backend Changes (`backend/websocket/gameSocket.js`)

#### 1. **Online Players Tracking**
Added `onlinePlayers` Map to track connected users:

```javascript
const onlinePlayers = new Map(); // userId -> {socketId, username, rating, status}
```

#### 2. **Connection Handler**
On connection:
- Extract user info from auth handshake
- Add player to `onlinePlayers` Map
- Broadcast `lobby:playerJoined` to all clients
- Send initial `lobby:onlinePlayers` list to new connection
- Log connection with player count

```javascript
if (userId) {
    onlinePlayers.set(userId, {
        socketId: socket.id,
        userId,
        username,
        rating,
        status: 'online'
    });
    
    console.log(`ðŸ‘¤ User ${username} (${userId}) connected - ${onlinePlayers.size} players online`);
    
    gameNamespace.emit('lobby:playerJoined', {
        userId, username, rating, status: 'online'
    });
    
    socket.emit('lobby:onlinePlayers', Array.from(onlinePlayers.values()));
}
```

#### 3. **Get Online Players Handler**
Listen for explicit request:

```javascript
socket.on('lobby:getOnlinePlayers', () => {
    socket.emit('lobby:onlinePlayers', Array.from(onlinePlayers.values()));
});
```

#### 4. **Game Join Handler**
Update status when joining game:

```javascript
if (onlinePlayers.has(userId)) {
    const player = onlinePlayers.get(userId);
    player.status = 'in-game';
    onlinePlayers.set(userId, player);
    
    gameNamespace.emit('lobby:playerStatusUpdate', {
        userId,
        status: 'in-game'
    });
}
```

#### 5. **Game Leave Handler**
Update status back to online:

```javascript
if (onlinePlayers.has(userId)) {
    const player = onlinePlayers.get(userId);
    player.status = 'online';
    onlinePlayers.set(userId, player);
    
    gameNamespace.emit('lobby:playerStatusUpdate', {
        userId,
        status: 'online'
    });
}
```

#### 6. **Disconnect Handler**
Remove from list and notify all:

```javascript
if (userId && onlinePlayers.has(userId)) {
    const player = onlinePlayers.get(userId);
    onlinePlayers.delete(userId);
    
    console.log(`ðŸ‘‹ User ${player.username} disconnected - ${onlinePlayers.size} players online`);
    
    gameNamespace.emit('lobby:playerLeft', userId);
}
```
