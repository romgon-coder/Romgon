```

### Step 2: Start Frontend

```

### Step 3: Test with Multiple Users

**Browser 1 (User 1):**
1. Open http://localhost:5500/deploy/index.html
2. Click "Continue as Guest" → Creates "guest_ABC123"
3. Lobby opens → Player list shows "You"
4. Note your guest ID (shown in player card)

3. Lobby opens → Player list shows 2 users now!

**Test Real-Time Updates:**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Player list shows 0 players

**Cause:** Chat backend not running or not connected

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Start backend
cd backend
npm start

# Check backend logs for:
# ✅ MongoDB connected successfully
# 🚀 Server running on port 3000

# Refresh frontend page
```

### Issue: "Chat offline" warning when sending friend request

**Cause:** romgonChat not initialized or connection failed

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 3000
3. Check `initializeChat()` was called in `showUserHome()`
4. Try refreshing page

### Issue: Player list stuck on mock data

**Cause:** `chatConnected` still false even with backend running

**Fix:**
1. Open browser console
2. Check `romgonChat.isConnected` value
3. Manually call `updatePlayerListFromChat()` in console
4. If still false, check backend WebSocket logs

### Issue: Tabs not switching

**Cause:** JavaScript error or missing element IDs

**Fix:**
1. Open browser console for errors
2. Verify IDs exist:
   - `all-players-tab`
   - `friends-players-tab`
   - `guests-players-tab`
   - `all-players-panel`
   - `friends-players-panel`
   - `guests-players-panel`
3. Check `switchPlayerListTab()` function is defined

### Issue: Friend modal won't open

**Cause:** Modal element missing or function not defined

**Fix:**
1. Verify `friend-management-modal` element exists
2. Check console for `showFriendManagementModal is not defined` error
3. Verify function is defined in `<script>` tag
4. Try calling `document.getElementById('friend-management-modal').style.display = 'flex'` in console

### Issue: Mobile layout broken

**Cause:** CSS media query not applying

**Fix:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Set viewport to 375px width (iPhone)
4. Verify `@media (max-width: 768px)` CSS exists
5. Check for `!important` flags in mobile styles
