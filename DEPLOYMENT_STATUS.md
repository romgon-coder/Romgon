## 🔍 How to Check Deployment Status

### Vercel (Frontend):
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "Romgon" project
3. Check latest deployment status
4. **Expected:** "Ready" within 1-2 minutes
5. **Test:** Open https://romgon.net

### Railway (Backend):
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open "romgon-backend" project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. **Expected:** "Active" after build completes
5. **Test:** `curl https://romgon-backend.railway.app/api/health`

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Step 1: Wait for Both Deployments
- ⏳ Vercel: 1-2 minutes
- ⏳ Railway: 2-3 minutes (if manual deploy)
- ✅ Both show "Active" or "Ready"

### Step 2: Test Backend Health
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://romgon-backend.railway.app/api/health')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(d => console.log('✅ Backend:', d))
    .catch(e => console.log('❌ Backend error:', e));
```

**Expected:** `✅ Backend: {status: "ok", timestamp: "..."}`

### Step 3: Test Frontend
1. Go to: https://romgon.net
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Click **"Guest Login"**
4. **Expected Console:**
   ```
   ✅ Guest account created: {id: X, username: "Guest_XXXX", token: "..."}
   ✅ userId: X
   ✅ token stored for active games
   ```

### Step 4: Test Lobby
1. Click **"Lobby"** button
2. **Expected Console:**
   ```
   🏠 Initializing lobby...
   ✅ Game WebSocket connected
   🔌 Socket ID: [id]
   🎧 Setting up online players listeners...
   📡 Requesting online players list...
   📋 Online players list received: [array]
   ✅ Lobby initialized
   ```
3. **Expected UI:**
   - Top shows: "**0 Players Online**" (or number of connected users)
   - Active Games: "No active games. Start a new game to get started!"
   - Stats show rating, wins/losses

### Step 5: Test Online Players (2 browsers)
1. **Browser 1:** Login as guest, go to Lobby
2. **Browser 2:** Login as guest (different guest), go to Lobby
3. **Expected:** Each browser shows "**1 Player Online**"
4. **Expected:** Player cards appear with usernames
5. Close Browser 2
6. **Expected:** Browser 1 updates to "**0 Players Online**"

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Cause:** Backend not deployed yet  
**Fix:** Deploy Railway backend (see options above)

### Problem: "WebSocket connection failed"
**Cause:** Railway backend not running or CORS issue  
**Fix:**
1. Check Railway logs
2. Verify backend is "Active"
3. Check Railway environment variables

### Problem: "0 Players Online" (even with 2 users)
**Cause:** WebSocket not connecting  
**Debug:**
```javascript
console.log('Socket:', gameSocket);
console.log('Connected:', gameSocket?.connected);
console.log('Backend:', 'https://romgon-backend.railway.app');
```
**Fix:**
1. Verify Railway backend is running
2. Check WebSocket endpoint is accessible
3. Test backend health endpoint

### Problem: Guest login fails
**Cause:** Backend API not responding  
**Debug:**
```javascript
fetch('https://romgon-backend.railway.app/api/auth/guest', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('✅', d))
.catch(e => console.log('❌', e));
```
**Fix:**
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify database is connected
3. Check guest route exists
