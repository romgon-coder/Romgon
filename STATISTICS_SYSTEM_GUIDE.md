# Statistics System Guide ðŸ“Š

## Overview
The game now has a **fully functional statistics tracking system** that connects real game data with the user interface.

## Features

### 1. **User Statistics Tracking**
- `getUserStats(username)` - Retrieve complete player statistics
- Tracks: games played, wins, losses, draws, last login, saved games, piece stats
- Persistent storage in localStorage under `romgon-users`

### 2. **Game Result Recording**
- `recordGameResult(username, result)` - Record game outcome
  - Parameters:
    - `winner`: username of winner
    - `loser`: username of loser
    - `moves`: number of moves played
    - `captureCount`: total pieces captured

### 3. **Last Login Tracking**
- `recordLastLogin(username)` - Updates last login timestamp
- Automatically called when user signs up
- Displayed in Account Modal as: "Last Login: Oct 19, 2025 at 3:45 PM"

### 4. **Game Persistence**
- `saveGame(username, gameName, gameData)` - Save game state
- `getSavedGames(username)` - Retrieve saved games list
- Saved games count displayed in Account Modal

### 5. **Statistics Dashboard**
- `renderStatsDashboard()` - Render player statistics with REAL data
- Displays:
  - Win/Loss Record with win rate percentage
  - Piece Performance by type (captures, survived, lost)
  - Move Quality Analysis (average moves, captures per game)
  - Personal Records (longest win streak, fastest win, total captures, member since)
  - Opening Repertoire (placeholder for future tracking)

### 6. **Account Modal Enhancement**
- Shows real game statistics:
  - Wins, Losses, Total Games
  - Last Login timestamp
  - Saved Games count
- All data pulls from actual game data, not hardcoded

## Data Structure

### User Stats Object
```javascript
{
  gamesPlayed: number,
  gamesWon: number,
  gamesLost: number,
  gamesDrawn: number,
  lastLogin: ISO timestamp,
  savedGames: array of saved game objects,
  pieceStats: {
    square: { captures: 0, survived: 0, lost: 0 },
    triangle: { captures: 0, survived: 0, lost: 0 },
    rhombus: { captures: 0, survived: 0, lost: 0 },
    circle: { captures: 0, survived: 0, lost: 0 },
    hexagon: { captures: 0, survived: 0, lost: 0 }
  },
  longestWinStreak: number,
  fastestWin: number or null,
  totalCaptures: number,
  totalMoves: number,
  registeredDate: ISO timestamp
}
```

## Testing the System

### Method 1: Use the Demo Function
```javascript
// In browser console:
simulateGameResult('username')
```

This will:
1. Record a random game result (20-100 moves, 3-10 captures)
2. Log the result to console
3. Refresh the statistics dashboard

**Steps to Test:**
1. Sign up for an account (e.g., "testplayer")
2. Open Account Settings (Menu â†’ Account)
3. Open Statistics Dashboard (Menu â†’ Statistics)
4. Open browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
5. Run: `simulateGameResult('testplayer')`
6. Watch statistics update in real-time!
7. Refresh Account Modal to see updated stats

### Method 2: Manual Game Result Recording
```javascript
// Record a win with 45 moves and 5 captures
recordGameResult('testplayer', {
  winner: 'testplayer',
  loser: 'opponent',
  moves: 45,
  captureCount: 5
})
```

### Method 3: Integration Points (For Developers)
When game ends, call:
```javascript
// Get current player
const currentUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('romgon-user'));

// Record result
recordGameResult(currentUser.username, {
  winner: currentUser.username,
  loser: 'opponent',
  moves: totalMovesPlayed,
  captureCount: totalPieces Captured
});

// Refresh dashboard
renderStatsDashboard();
```

## What's Connected

âœ… **Account Modal** â†’ Shows real stats
âœ… **Statistics Dashboard** â†’ Shows real stats with win rate, piece performance
âœ… **Last Login** â†’ Tracked and displayed
âœ… **Saved Games** â†’ Saved and counted in profile
âœ… **Sign-up Process** â†’ Automatically records first login
âœ… **localStorage** â†’ All data persisted across sessions

## What's Ready to Integrate

The following game-end events should call `recordGameResult()`:
1. User wins a game against AI
2. User wins against another player
3. Game ends in draw
4. User loses to AI
5. User loses to another player

The following should call tracking functions:
- Piece capture â†’ `trackPiecePerformance()`
- Save game â†’ `saveGame()`
- Game analysis â†’ Update opening repertoire

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Piece performance tracking during gameplay
- [ ] Opening repertoire tracking and analysis
- [ ] Move quality classification (brilliant, good, inaccuracy, mistake, blunder)
- [ ] Win streak tracking during gameplay
- [ ] Progress chart visualization
- [ ] Head-to-head statistics against opponents
- [ ] Export statistics as JSON/CSV
- [ ] Rating system integration

## Usage Examples

### Check if user has statistics:
```javascript
const stats = getUserStats('testplayer');
if (stats && stats.gamesPlayed > 0) {
  console.log(`${stats.gamesWon}W - ${stats.gamesLost}L`);
}
```

### Get win rate:
```javascript
const winRate = getWinRate('testplayer'); // Returns 0-100
console.log(`Win rate: ${winRate}%`);
```

### Get average game length:
```javascript
const avgMoves = getAvgMovesPerGame('testplayer');
console.log(`Average: ${avgMoves} moves per game`);
```

### Save a game:
```javascript
saveGame('testplayer', 'Epic Victory vs AI', {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  opponent: 'AI (Hard)',
  result: 'win',
  moves: 42,
  captures: 8
});
```

## Important Notes

- **Data Persistence**: All statistics are saved in localStorage
- **Guest Users**: Statistics are NOT saved for guest users (session-only)
- **Account Modal**: Only works when logged in as registered user
- **Login Tracking**: Automatically updated on sign-up and can be called manually
- **No Backend**: All data is client-side (localStorage)

## Troubleshooting

**Statistics not showing:**
- Ensure user is logged in (check Account Modal)
- Open browser console and run: `getUserStats('username')`
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('romgon-users')`

**Last Login shows "Never":**
- User hasn't logged in yet, or `recordLastLogin()` hasn't been called
- Manually call: `recordLastLogin('username')`

**Save Games not tracking:**
- Use `saveGame()` function to manually save
- Check: `getSavedGames('username')`
