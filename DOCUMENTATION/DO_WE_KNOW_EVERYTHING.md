## 📊 COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE MAP

### **1. MOVEMENT SYSTEM - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

#### **Each Piece Type Has Its Own Functions:**

**Square (□/■)** - Line 14062-14926
- `canSquareAttack()` → Line 14062
- `showSquareMovementPattern()` → Line 14926
- Movement: 1 space any direction (8 directions)
- Can capture on any adjacent hex

**Triangle (△/▲)** - Lines 14097-14846
- `canWhiteTriangleAttack()` → Line 14097
- `canBlackTriangleAttack()` → Line 14117
- `showWhiteTriangleMovementPattern()` → Line 14355
- `showTriangleMovementPattern()` → Line 14456
- `getTriangleOrientation()` → Line 14547
- `rotateTriangleLeft()` → Line 14564
- `rotateTriangleRight()` → Line 14617
- Movement: Forward only (color-specific)
- **Can ROTATE** - changes movement direction

**Circle (○/●)** - Lines 14143-15149+
- `canCircleAttack()` → Line 14143
- `showCircleMovementPattern()` → Line ~15149
- Movement: Orthogonal (straight lines)
- Long-range movement

**Hexagon (⬡/⬢)** - Lines 14224, 22306, 28003
- `canHexgonAttack()` → Line 14224 ⚠️ Uses getRotatedHexgonTargets
- `showHexgonMovementPattern()` → Line 28003 ⚠️ Uses getRotatedHexgonTargets
- `getRotatedHexgonTargets()` → Line 22306 (shared for attack AND movement)
- Movement: 6-directional pattern (rotation-dependent)
- Special: Base capture wins game
- **Can ROTATE** - changes movement/attack pattern
- **CRITICAL: Movement = Attack** (NO escape-only moves)

**Rhombus (◇/◆)** - Lines 14249-15069
- `canRhombusAttack()` → Line 14249 ⚠️ Blocks diagonal escapes
- `showRhombusMovementPattern()` → Line 15069
- Movement: Diagonal + escape moves (Dead Zone ↔ Inner Perimeter)
- Long-range diagonal
- **SPECIAL RULE:** Diagonal ESCAPE moves CANNOT attack (Line 14265)
- **CRITICAL: Movement ≠ Attack** (HAS escape-only moves)

### ⚠️ **ATTACK vs MOVEMENT DISTINCTION - NOW DOCUMENTED ✅**

**Rule Summary:**
- **Square, Triangle, Circle, Hexagon:** Movement = Attack ✅
- **Rhombus ONLY:** Movement ≠ Attack (has diagonal escape moves) ❌

**Hexagon Implementation:**
- Both attack and movement use same function: `getRotatedHexgonTargets()` (Line 22306)
- No escape-only moves exist
- All movement squares can also attack

**Rhombus Implementation:**
- Diagonal escapes: Dead Zone (3-3, 3-4, 3-5) ↔ Inner Perimeter jumps
- `canRhombusAttack()` has `isDiagonalMove` check that blocks escape attacks
- Search "isDiagonalMove" in Line 14249+ to see implementation

---

### **2. MAIN MOVE EXECUTION - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

**The Core Drop Handler** - Line 27533
```
addEventListener('drop') at Line 27533
│
├─> Check if hex has valid highlight
├─> Enforce base defense rule
├─> Check for piece capture
├─> Sanitize piece classes
├─> Execute move
├─> Update DOM
├─> Record move
├─> Check win conditions
└─> Switch turn
```

**Key Sections in Drop Handler:**
- Line 27533: Event listener starts
- Line 27545: Highlight validation
- Line 27553: Rhombus diagonal capture block
- Line 27569: Piece color detection
- Line 27573: Base defense rule
- Line 27591: Piece capture check
- Line 27595: Class sanitization
- (continues to ~27800+)

---

### **3. GAME INITIALIZATION - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

```
Lobby (Line 7300)
  ↓
startPvPLocal() → Line 16680
  ↓
initializeBoard() → Line 16144
  ↓
setupDragAndDrop() → Line ~15990
  ↓
Game Active (waiting for input)
```

---

### **4. WIN CONDITIONS - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

**Main Function:** `checkWinConditions()` → Line 25426

**Three Win Types:**
1. **Base Capture** - Hexagon piece reaches opponent's base
2. **King Capture** - All 5 opponent piece types eliminated
3. **Stalemate** - Opponent has no legal moves (DRAW)

**Special Check:** `checkRhombusDeadlock()` - Detects rhombus-only stalemate

---

### **5. AI SYSTEM - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

```
startAIGame() → Line 19835
  ↓
makeAIMove() → Line 21442
  ↓
minimax() or evaluation function
  ↓
Execute computer move
  ↓
Back to player turn
```

---

### **6. ALL UI PANELS - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

| Panel | ID | Line | Status |
|-------|-----|------|--------|
| Lobby | `start-menu` | 7300 | ✅ Known |
| Board | `board-display-container` | 10650 | ✅ Known |
| White Eliminated | `white-eliminated` | 10670 | ✅ Known |
| Black Eliminated | `black-eliminated` | 10670 | ✅ Known |
| Sandbox Panel | `sandbox-tools-panel` | 10695 | ✅ Known |
| Camera Panel | `camera-panel` | 12800 | ✅ Known |
| Move History | `white-moves`, `black-moves` | 10685 | ✅ Known |

---

### **7. SPECIAL MECHANICS - FULLY MAPPED ✅**

**Triangle Rotation** (Lines 14547-14670)
- Store orientation per hex
- Rotate left/right changes movement pattern
- Visual indicator updates

**Rhombus Diagonal Rule** (Line 27553)
- Diagonal moves = movement ONLY
- Cannot capture on diagonal
- Explicitly blocked in drop handler

**Base Defense Rule** (Line 27573)
- `enforceBaseDefenseRule()` called
- Prevents certain moves near base
- Variant-specific behavior

---

## 🎮 THE COMPLETE CALL CHAIN

### **From Click to Move Completion:**

```
1. User clicks piece
   → dragstart event (Line 15998)
   
2. Highlights appear
   → showSquareMovementPattern() etc. (Lines 14000+)
   
3. User drags to hex
   → dragover event (validates)
   
4. User drops piece
   → drop event (Line 27533) ← **THE MAIN ENGINE**
   
5. Inside drop handler:
   ├─ Line 27545: Validate highlight exists
   ├─ Line 27553: Check rhombus diagonal rule
   ├─ Line 27569: Detect piece colors
   ├─ Line 27573: Enforce base defense
   ├─ Line 27591: Check for capture
   ├─ Line 27595: Sanitize classes
   ├─ Move piece DOM element
   ├─ recordMoveRPN() → Save notation
   ├─ highlightLastMove() → Visual feedback
   ├─ checkWinConditions() → Line 25426
   └─ switchTurn() → Line 23367
   
6. If AI enabled:
   → makeAIMove() (Line 21442)
   → Loops back to step 4
```

## 🔍 WHAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW

### **Minor Gaps (Not Critical):**

1. **Hexagon Movement Details**
   - Functions exist but exact lines needed
   - Search: "hexgon" or "hexagon" will find them

2. **Opening Book Location**
   - If it exists, need to search: "openingBook"

3. **Some Sound Functions**
   - General locations known, exact lines searchable

4. **Network/Multiplayer Code**
   - May or may not exist
   - Search: "WebSocket" or "socket.io"

5. **Some Modal Dialogs**
   - IDs known, exact HTML locations searchable

---

## ✅ WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

### **You Can Now:**

1. ✅ **Find ANY function in seconds**
   - Use SEARCH_CHEATSHEET.md
   - Copy search term
   - Find exact line

2. ✅ **Understand the call order**
   - Use VISUAL_GAME_FLOW_MAP.md
   - See what calls what, when

3. ✅ **Modify ANY game mechanic**
   - Use GAME_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md
   - Find the section
   - Make changes confidently

4. ✅ **Explain to AI agents EXACTLY where to look**
   - No more: "Find triangle movement somewhere..."
   - Now: "Line 14456, function showTriangleMovementPattern()"

## 🎓 EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH AI

### **Before (Blind Search):**
```
You: "I want to change how triangles move"
AI: "Searching for triangle movement..."
AI: *searches 20 minutes*
AI: "Found some triangle code, not sure if this is it..."
```

### **Now (Precise):**
```
You: "Line 14456, showTriangleMovementPattern(), 
      change the movement offsets"
AI: "Found it! Here's the code at line 14456..."
AI: *makes change in 30 seconds*
```
