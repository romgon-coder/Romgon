# 🚨 Railway Deployment Issue

## Problem
Railway backend is not responding:
- URL: https://romgon-backend.railway.app
- Test: `curl https://romgon-backend.railway.app/api/health` → **404 Not Found**

## Possible Causes

### 1. Deployment Failed
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
- Look for red "Failed" status
- Check build logs for errors

### 2. Wrong URL
- Railway may have changed your domain
- Check "Settings" → "Domains" in Railway dashboard
- Update frontend `BACKEND_API_URL` if needed

### 3. Backend Not Running
- Railway may have stopped the service
- Free tier can go to sleep
- Check if service needs to be restarted

### 4. Build Failed
- railway.json might have wrong build command
- Check if `npm install` succeeded
- Check if dependencies installed correctly

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your backend project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for latest deployment status

### Step 2: Check Logs
Click on the failed deployment (if any) and check logs for:
- ❌ Build errors
- ❌ npm install errors  
- ❌ Database connection errors
- ❌ Port binding errors

### Step 3: Check Domain
1. Go to "Settings" tab
2. Scroll to "Domains"
3. Verify the domain is: `romgon-backend.railway.app`
4. If different, update `deploy/index.html`:
   ```javascript
   const BACKEND_API_URL = 'https://YOUR-NEW-DOMAIN.railway.app';
   ```

### Step 4: Redeploy
If deployment failed:
1. Click "Redeploy" button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Check logs for success
4. Test: `curl https://romgon-backend.railway.app/api/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T..."
}
```

## Common Railway Errors

### Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"
**Fix:** Make sure `railway.json` has correct paths:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && npm install && npm start"
  }
}
```

### Error: "Cannot find module"
**Fix:** Check package.json dependencies are installed

### Error: "Port already in use"
**Fix:** Backend should use `process.env.PORT` (Railway sets this)

### Error: "Database not found"
**Fix:** Check if SQLite file path is correct in Railway environment

## Testing Locally

To test if backend code is correct, run locally:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Then test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

If works locally but not on Railway → Railway deployment issue.

## What to Report

When checking Railway, note:
1. ✅ or ❌ Deployment status
2. 📋 Any error messages in logs
3. 🌐 Current domain/URL
4. 📊 Build time and memory usage
5. ⏱️ When last deployment succeeded
