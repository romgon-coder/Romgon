# ü§ñ AI Improvements for ROMGON

## Current AI Status
- Has 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Uses move evaluation with scoring system
- Has basic lookahead on "hard" mode
- Understands captures, threats, rhombus advancement

## üöÄ Planned Improvements

### 1. **Opening Book Integration**
- Use predefined opening moves from OPENING_BOOK
- First 2-3 moves follow strong opening theory
- Faster start, better positioning

### 2. **Enhanced Piece Coordination**
- **Pawn chains**: Keep squares together for support
- **Triangle screen**: Use triangles to protect rhombus
- **Circle mobility**: Position circles for jump threats
- **Hexagon control**: Use hexagons to control key squares

### 3. **Tactical Pattern Recognition**
- **Forks**: Attack 2+ pieces simultaneously
- **Pins**: Attack piece that's protecting another
- **Skewers**: Force valuable piece to move, expose weaker piece behind
- **Discovery attacks**: Move one piece to reveal attack from another
- **Sacrifice patterns**: Trade piece for positional advantage

### 4. **Improved Threat Evaluation**
- **Cascade threats**: If we capture here, what opens up?
- **Trapped pieces**: Detect when opponent pieces have no moves
- **Tempo advantage**: Force opponent to react defensively
- **Initiative**: Maintain constant pressure

### 5. **Better Rhombus Strategy**
- **Early game**: Keep rhombus at base until support ready
- **Mid game**: Advance with escort pieces
- **Late game**: Race to goal or defend based on piece count
- **Endgame**: Calculate forced win sequences

### 6. **Zone Control**
- **Control center row (3)**: Critical for rhombus advancement
- **Flank control**: Prevent opponent from surrounding us
- **Base defense**: Always keep at least 1 piece defending goal

### 7. **Piece Value Adjustments**
Based on game phase:
- **Opening**: Squares = 120, Triangles = 150 (development)
- **Midgame**: Rhombus threats = 600+, defensive pieces = 200
- **Endgame**: Any piece = 300+ (critical for both sides)

### 8. **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- Search depth 3-4 moves ahead (hard mode)
- Prune obviously bad branches early
- Cache evaluated positions
- **Estimated improvement**: 2-3x better tactical awareness

### 9. **Positional Understanding**
- **Weak squares**: Hexes that can't be defended
- **Strong squares**: Hexes we control with multiple pieces
- **Pawn structure**: Keep pieces connected
- **King safety** (Rhombus): Keep escape routes open

### 10. **Time Management** (for future)
- Spend more time on critical positions
- Quick moves in obvious positions
- Resign in hopeless situations

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Improvements:
- Easy: Beginner level (random weak moves)
- Medium: Intermediate (50% good moves)
- Hard: Advanced (best single move)

### After Improvements:
- Easy: Beginner+ (still beatable, better openings)
- Medium: Intermediate+ (good tactics, 70% correct)
- Hard: Expert (minimax lookahead, opening book, endgame tables)

## üéØ Implementation Priority

1. ‚úÖ Opening book (quick win, immediate improvement)
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced evaluation weights (tune existing system)
3. ‚úÖ Piece coordination bonuses
4. ‚è≥ Tactical pattern detection
5. ‚è≥ Minimax with alpha-beta (major upgrade)
6. ‚è≥ Endgame tablebase (if needed)

## üß™ Testing Plan

1. Play 10 games vs current "hard" AI
2. Measure win rate: should go from 50-50 to 30-70 (AI favor)
3. Check for:
   - Faster checkmates when winning
   - Better defense when losing
   - No blunders (losing pieces for nothing)
   - Strategic coherence (not random moves)
