# âœ… Vercel Deployment Fix - October 20, 2025

## Problem
When visiting `romgon.net`, users saw Vercel's default page instead of the ROMGON login page.

## Root Cause
There was a root-level `index.html` file in the repository that Vercel was serving instead of the `frontend/index.html`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `.vercelignore`
Added the following to exclude old files from Vercel deployment:
```
index.html          # Root-level file (old)
*.HTML              # Old HTML files
board.HTML          # Old game file
live-romgon.html    # Old file
*.md                # Documentation files
```

### 2. Updated Root `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "",
  "installCommand": "echo 'No install needed'",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend",
  "public": "frontend",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### 3. Created `frontend/vercel.json`
Added explicit configuration in the frontend folder:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "",
  "installCommand": "echo 'No install needed'",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Changes Made
- âœ… Updated `.vercelignore`
- âœ… Updated root `vercel.json` with explicit `"outputDirectory": "frontend"`
- âœ… Created `frontend/vercel.json` for explicit routing
- âœ… Pushed to GitHub (auto-deploy triggered)

## Expected Result
After Vercel redeploys (1-2 minutes):
- âœ… `romgon.net` will show the ROMGON login page
- âœ… All routes will work correctly
- âœ… Assets will load properly

## Testing
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel deployment
2. Visit: https://romgon.net
3. Should see: ðŸŽ® ROMGON login form
4. Click "Create Account" button to register

## Status
ðŸ”„ **Deployment in progress**  
Vercel should complete within 1-2 minutes.
