# ⚙️ MANUAL VERCEL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

## The Problem
Vercel cannot find your frontend files because it doesn't know to look in the `/frontend` folder.

## The Solution (Manual Fix Needed)

You must go to the **Vercel Dashboard** and configure the root directory:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   
2. **Select ROMGON Project:**
   - Click on "romgon-frontapi" or your project name

3. **Go to Settings:**
   - Click **Settings** in the top navigation

4. **Find "Build & Development Settings":**
   - Scroll down to **Root Directory**
   - Current value: `.` (root)
   - **Change to:** `frontend`
   - Click **Save**

5. **Redeploy:**
   - Go back to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the **three dots** on the latest failed deployment
   - Select **Redeploy**
   - Wait for it to deploy

### What This Does:
- Tells Vercel: "Look in the frontend/ folder for the static files"
- Your files will be served correctly
- https://romgon.net will show your game

---

## Why This is Needed:
- Vercel's `vercel.json` "public" field doesn't work for static sites
- The `--outputDirectory` only affects build output (we have no build)
- The **Root Directory** setting in the dashboard is the only reliable way

---

## After This Fix:
✅ https://romgon.net → Your game login page  
✅ https://api.romgon.net → Your backend API  
✅ Everything should work!

---

**This is a one-time manual configuration needed on Vercel's side.**

Once done, all future git pushes will auto-deploy to the `frontend` folder correctly.
