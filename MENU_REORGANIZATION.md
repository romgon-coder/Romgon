## 🎯 Rationale

### Why move AI Reasoning & Variants to Game Modes?
- **Better organization:** These are game mode variations, not advanced options
- **User discovery:** Players looking for different ways to play will find them easily
- **Logical grouping:** Fits with other gameplay options like PVP, AI, and Puzzles

### Why move Game Creator to Account?
- **User content:** Game Creator is about creating personal/custom content
- **Profile association:** Custom games are tied to user accounts
- **Space optimization:** Account section had room, Game Modes was getting crowded

### Why add Engine Analysis to Advanced Options?
- **Developer tool:** Technical monitoring for advanced users
- **Natural fit:** Belongs with other advanced features like Game Engine API
- **Accessibility:** Easy to find for users who need performance monitoring

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Color Coding
Each section maintains its distinct color theme:
- **Game Modes:** Orange (#f57d2d) - Warm, inviting
- **Account:** Gold (#ffd700) - Premium, personal
- **Advanced:** Cyan (#00d2ff) - Technical, professional

### Icon Updates
- **Engine Analysis:** 🔧 (wrench) - Technical tool
- **AI Reasoning:** 🧠 (brain) - Intelligence
- **Variants:** 🎯 (dart) - Precision modes
- **Game Creator:** 🎨 (palette) - Creative tool

### Hover Effects
All buttons retain smooth transitions with glowing text shadows on hover

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Open the game:** https://romgon-coder.github.io/Romgon/
2. **Click Start Menu** (if not auto-shown)
3. **Verify sections:**
   - GAME MODES should have 6 items (including AI Reasoning & Variants)
   - ACCOUNT should have 5 items (including Game Creator)
   - ADVANCED OPTIONS should have Engine Analysis at the top

4. **Test functionality:**
   - ✅ AI Reasoning still opens LLM variants modal
   - ✅ Variants still opens game modes modal
   - ✅ Game Creator still navigates to game-creator.html
   - ✅ Engine Analysis opens dashboard in new tab
