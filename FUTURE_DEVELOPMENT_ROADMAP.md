## 🎯 Quick-Win Improvements (Can Start Immediately)

These items don't require backend changes and can improve the game now:

- [ ] **Piece Animation Polish**: Smoother piece movements
- [ ] **Move History UI**: Better display of past moves
- [ ] **Theme Expansion**: More color scheme options
- [ ] **Sound Design**: Better audio feedback and effects
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Faster game controls
  - **Implementation Note for PvP**:
    - **Player 1 (Black)**: Standard orientation
      - Arrow keys: Up/Down/Left/Right for hex navigation
      - WASD: Alternative controls (W=Up, A=Left, S=Down, D=Right)
      - Solution: Use **logical hex coordinates** (q, r) system
    - **Player 2 (White)**: Rotated 180° view
      - **Option A - Auto-rotate input mapping**: Convert Player 2 inputs by rotating 180°
        - Internally track position in same coordinate system
        - Player 2's "up" = Player 1's "down" + 180° rotation
      - **Option B - Player-relative controls**: 
        - Both players always use same keys (up/down/left/right from their perspective)
        - System automatically adjusts based on active player
        - More intuitive for split-screen play
      - **Option C - Screen rotation toggle**:
        - Player 1 sees normal board
        - Player 2 sees board rotated 180°
        - Same coordinate system, visual transformation only
    - **Recommended**: Option B for PvP (most intuitive)
- [ ] **Screenshot/Share**: Easy sharing of game positions
- [ ] **Local Replay System**: Rewatch your past games locally
- [ ] **PGN Import/Export**: Import other game formats
- [ ] **Statistics Dashboard**: Better stat visualization
- [ ] **Settings Polish**: More granular preference options
- [ ] **Variant Rules Clarity**: Better in-game rule explanations

### Keyboard Navigation & Board Rotation Implementation Details

#### Understanding Hexagonal Coordinates

For ROMGON's hexagonal board, use the **Axial Coordinate System (q, r)**:

```
    q increases →
    
    (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0)
  (-1,1) (0,1) (1,1)
    (-1,2) (0,2) (1,2)
    
r increases ↓
```

#### Player 1 (Black) Controls - Normal View

```javascript
const moveMap = {
  'ArrowUp': { dq: 0, dr: -1 },    // Move up
  'ArrowDown': { dq: 0, dr: 1 },   // Move down
  'ArrowLeft': { dq: -1, dr: 0 },  // Move left
  'ArrowRight': { dq: 1, dr: 0 },  // Move right
};

// For diagonal movements (if needed):
'w': { dq: 0, dr: -1 },   // Up
'a': { dq: -1, dr: 0 },   // Left
's': { dq: 0, dr: 1 },    // Down
'd': { dq: 1, dr: 0 },    // Right
```

#### Player 2 (White) Controls - Rotated 180°

**Key Insight**: For 180° rotation on hexagonal board:
- Reverse both q and r directions
- Player 2's perspective is "upside down"

```javascript
// Option B Implementation (Player-Relative Controls):
function getMovementDelta(key, playerNumber) {
  const player1Moves = {
    'ArrowUp': { dq: 0, dr: -1 },
    'ArrowDown': { dq: 0, dr: 1 },
    'ArrowLeft': { dq: -1, dr: 0 },
    'ArrowRight': { dq: 1, dr: 0 },
  };
  
  let delta = player1Moves[key];
  
  // For Player 2, rotate 180° by negating both q and r
  if (playerNumber === 2 && delta) {
    return { dq: -delta.dq, dr: -delta.dr };
  }
  
  return delta;
}

// Example usage:
// Player 1 presses ArrowRight: moves +1 on q axis
// Player 2 presses ArrowRight: moves -1 on q axis (appears as "left" from their rotated view)
```

#### Visual Board Rotation

```javascript
// Optional: If displaying board rotated for Player 2
function drawBoardForPlayer(player) {
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  if (player === 2) {
    ctx.save();
    // Rotate canvas 180° around center
    ctx.translate(boardCenterX, boardCenterY);
    ctx.rotate(Math.PI); // 180 degrees
    ctx.translate(-boardCenterX, -boardCenterY);
  }
  
  // Draw board
  drawHexagons();
  
  if (player === 2) {
    ctx.restore();
  }
}
```

#### Split-Screen Alternating Control Flow

```javascript
let activePlayer = 1; // 1 = Black, 2 = White

document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  const delta = getMovementDelta(e.key, activePlayer);
  
  if (delta) {
    // Move piece using unified coordinate system
    moveSelectedPiece(delta.dq, delta.dr);
    
    // After move confirmation, switch player
    // activePlayer = activePlayer === 1 ? 2 : 1;
  }
});
```

#### Handling Different Board Orientations

**Option C - Board Rotation Visualization**:

```javascript
// All game logic uses same coordinate system
// Only visual rendering differs

function renderBoard(playerNumber) {
  const centerX = canvas.width / 2;
  const centerY = canvas.height / 2;
  
  ctx.save();
  
  // Rotate visual representation for Player 2
  if (playerNumber === 2) {
    ctx.translate(centerX, centerY);
    ctx.rotate(Math.PI);
    ctx.translate(-centerX, -centerY);
  }
  
  // All hex drawing code remains the same
  for (let q = -3; q <= 3; q++) {
    for (let r = -3; r <= 3; r++) {
      drawHexAtCoordinate(q, r);
    }
  }
  
  ctx.restore();
}
```

#### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Step 1 - Add Unified Keyboard Input Handler**
   - Track current active player
   - Map keys to coordinate deltas
   - Work for single player first

2. **Step 2 - Implement Player 2 Input Rotation**
   - Modify `getMovementDelta()` to negate coordinates for Player 2
   - Test alternating between P1 and P2 controls

3. **Step 3 - Optional Visual Board Rotation**
   - Add canvas rotation for Player 2's view
   - Keep all logic in same coordinate system
   - More polished but not necessary

4. **Step 4 - Add UI Indicators**
   - Show which player's turn
   - Display whose controls are active
   - Add move validation feedback

#### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Player 1 can navigate all hexes with arrow keys
- [ ] Player 2 arrow keys move opposite direction (visually correct from their view)
- [ ] Coordinate system stays consistent internally
- [ ] Board rotation (if implemented) matches input mapping
- [ ] Turn switching works smoothly
- [ ] No off-by-one coordinate errors
- [ ] Pieces move to correct positions for both players

#### Code Location in ROMGON

Add these functions to the main game script:
- `getMovementDelta(key, playerNumber)` - Map keys to coordinate changes
- `handleKeyboardInput(event)` - Central keyboard handler
- `switchActivePlayer()` - Change control perspective
- `renderBoardForPlayer(playerNumber)` - Optional rotation rendering
