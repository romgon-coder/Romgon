## 1. Game Overview
Romgon is a strategic hexagonal board game. Each player controls **7 pieces**:
- 5 unique types (Square, Triangle, Rhombus, Circle, Hexagon)
- **Plus 1 extra Triangle and 1 extra Square** (total: 2 Triangles, 2 Squares, 1 Rhombus, 1 Circle, 1 Hexagon per player)

The objective is to advance your rhombus to the opponent's base or create a deadlock (see below).

---

## 2. Board Layout
- **Hexagonal grid**: 7 rows (0-6), variable columns per row
- **Zones**:
  - Dead Zone (center)
  - Inner, Middle, Outer Perimeter
- **Coordinates**: Each hex is labeled (e.g., 3-4)

---

## 3. Piece Types & Movement
### Square
- Moves orthogonally (adjacent hexes)
- Attacks in same directions

### Triangle
- 6 unique movement patterns (one for each orientation)
- Can rotate left/right after moving (not after attacking)
- Each orientation has its own movement pattern (no repeats)

### Rhombus
- Must reach opponent's base to win (White: 3-8, Black: 3-0)
- Moves orthogonally
- Special diagonal move between Dead Zone and Inner Perimeter (cannot capture)
- Cannot capture other rhombuses
- Cannot move into deadlock (unless capturing attacker)

### Circle
- Moves within current perimeter zone
- Uses gateways to change zones (ends turn)
- Cannot jump friendly pieces

### Hexagon
- 6 orientations (rotatable)
- 3 unique movement patterns

---

## 4. Turn Structure

- Captures: Move to opponent's hex to capture
- Cannot move to a hex occupied by a friendly piece

---

## 5. Special Rules

- **Deadlock**: Win if opponent's rhombus is under attack with no legal moves
- **Draglock**: Lose if you have no legal moves (must resign)

- **Three-fold Repetition**: Loss if same position occurs three times (no draws in Romgon)
- **Five-fold Shuttle**: Lose if you repeat a shuttle pattern (Aâ†’Bâ†’A) five times
- **Undo/Redo**: Allowed unless playing online or in tournament

---

## 6. Victory Conditions

## 11. Base Defense Rule

- **Standard Rule:** Only the defending rhombus (on its own base) can prevent the opponentâ€™s rhombus from entering the base. Other pieces do not block entry, even if their attack pattern covers the base.
    - If the defending rhombus is not present, the opponentâ€™s rhombus may enter and win.
    - The game will prevent illegal rhombus escapes if the base is defended by the rhombus.

- **Fortress Variant:** Any piece (not just the rhombus) that attacks the base hex can prevent the opponentâ€™s rhombus from entering, until it is eliminated or moved.
    - The pop-up for illegal movement will appear if the base is defended by any opponent pieceâ€™s attack pattern.
    - This variant allows for more complex blockades and defensive tactics.
