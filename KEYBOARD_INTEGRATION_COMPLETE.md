# ‚å®Ô∏è ROMGON Keyboard Navigation Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The keyboard navigation system has been fully integrated into ROMGON's game engine. Players can now control pieces using arrow keys or WASD with automatic 180¬∞ rotation support for Player 2.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Keyboard Navigation System** (`keyboard-navigation.js`)
- Arrow keys and WASD support for piece movement
- Automatic Player 2 180¬∞ rotation via coordinate negation
- Piece selection with visual highlighting
- Move confirmation (Space/Enter) and deselection (Escape)
- CSS pulsing animation for selected pieces

### 2. **Game Integration Layer** (`keyboard-game-integration.js`)
- Bridges keyboard navigation with game's drag-and-drop system
- Implements `window.gameMovePiece()` and `window.gameConfirmMove()` hooks
- Simulates complete drag-drop flow including:
  - Piece capture/elimination
  - Move recording and RPN notation
  - Turn switching
  - Audio feedback
  - Board state updates
- Preserves piece orientation (triangles/hexagons)
- Updates player indicator UI on turn changes

### 3. **UI Components**
- **Player Indicator**: Shows current player (Black/White) in top-right corner
- **Keyboard Help Overlay**: Displays control shortcuts in bottom-left corner
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected pieces glow with cyan outline and pulsing animation

### 4. **CSS Styling** (Added to both HTML files)
```css
.kb-selected {
  outline: 3px solid #4ecdc4;
  box-shadow: pulsing glow effect;
  animation: kb-pulse 0.6s infinite;
}

#kb-player-indicator {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px; right: 20px;
  Shows: ‚ôü BLACK (P1) or ‚ôö WHITE (P2)
}

#kb-help-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 20px; left: 20px;
  Shows keyboard shortcuts
}
```

## How It Works

### Player 1 (Black) Controls - Normal Movement
```
Arrow Keys or WASD
‚Üë or W: Move Up    (dr: -1, dc: 0)
‚Üì or S: Move Down  (dr: +1, dc: 0)
‚Üê or A: Move Left  (dr: 0, dc: -1)
‚Üí or D: Move Right (dr: 0, dc: +1)
```

### Player 2 (White) Controls - 180¬∞ Rotated
When Player 2 moves, the system **negates both directions**:
```
User presses ‚Üí: Feels like "right" from Player 2's view
System converts: (dr: 0, dc: -1) due to negation
Result: Moves "left" in unified coordinate system
Visually: Correct relative to Player 2's perspective
```

### Integration Flow
```
[User presses Arrow Key]
        ‚Üì
[KeyboardNavigationSystem detects]
        ‚Üì
[For Player 2: Negate coordinates]
        ‚Üì
[window.gameMovePiece() called]
        ‚Üì
[KeyboardGameIntegration executes]
        ‚Üì
[Simulates drag-drop: Get piece ‚Üí Move ‚Üí Capture ‚Üí Record]
        ‚Üì
[All game functions triggered]
        ‚Üì
[Turn switches + UI updates]
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `keyboard-navigation.js` - Core keyboard system (240 lines)
- `deploy/keyboard-navigation.js` - Deployed version
- `keyboard-game-integration.js` - Game integration (280 lines)
- `deploy/keyboard-game-integration.js` - Deployed version

### Modified Files
- `index.html` - Added script tags + CSS + UI elements + initialization
- `deploy/index.html` - Same as above

## Features

‚úÖ **Piece Movement**
- Arrow keys/WASD for natural board navigation
- Works with all piece types (square, triangle, rhombus, circle, hexgon)
- Respects game rules (can't move opponent's pieces)
- Validates move legality (only to highlighted hexes)

‚úÖ **Capture Mechanics**
- Captures opponent pieces automatically on drop
- Records capture in move history
- Plays capture sound

‚úÖ **Rotatable Pieces**
- Triangles and hexagons maintain orientation during moves
- Can rotate and continue turn without switching

‚úÖ **Player 2 Rotation**
- Automatic 180¬∞ coordinate transformation
- Makes keyboard controls feel natural from both perspectives
- No special keys needed - just use arrow keys

‚úÖ **Turn Management**
- Automatically switches turns after non-rotatable pieces move
- Allows free rotation for triangles/hexagons before turn end
- Updates player indicator

‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**
- Cyan pulsing outline for selected pieces
- Player indicator shows current active player
- Keyboard help displayed in corner
- All game UI updates (highlights, threats, last move)

## Game Integration Points

The system hooks into existing game functions:
- `draggedPiece` & `draggedFromHex` - Drag state
- `setupDragAndDrop()` - Movement validation
- `recordMove()` & `recordMoveRPN()` - Move history
- `switchTurn()` - Turn management
- `highlightLastMove()` - UI feedback
- `checkWinConditions()` - Game state
- `playCapturedSound()` - Audio feedback

## Usage

### Enable Keyboard Controls
1. Start a game at romgon.net
2. Keyboard controls automatically initialize
3. Look for "‚å®Ô∏è KB:" indicator in top-right corner

### Player 1 (Black)
```
‚å®Ô∏è Controls feel natural:
  ‚Üê ‚Üí Move side to side
  ‚Üë ‚Üì Move forward/backward
```

### Player 2 (White)  
```
‚å®Ô∏è Controls feel natural from opposite view:
  ‚Üê ‚Üí Appear to move opposite
  ‚Üë ‚Üì Appear to move opposite
(Internally rotated 180¬∞ by system)
```

### Making a Move
```
1. Press arrow key near piece ‚Üí Select it
2. Press arrow keys ‚Üí Move through highlighted squares
3. Space/Enter ‚Üí Confirm move
4. Escape ‚Üí Deselect piece

For triangles/hexagons:
5. Can rotate before ending turn (via UI or future kbd shortcut)
```

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System
- Game uses: `hex-row-col` format (e.g., `hex-3-4`)
- Board: 7 rows √ó 9 cols (indices 0-6, 0-8)
- Pieces: Stored as DOM elements with piece classes
  - Black: `.square-piece` / `.triangle-piece` / `.rhombus-piece` / `.circle-piece` / `.hexgon-piece`
  - White: Same + `.white-*` class

### Player 2 Rotation Formula
```javascript
if (activePlayer === 2) {
  dr = -dr;  // Negate row delta
  dc = -dc;  // Negate column delta
}
// Result: Input feels natural but moves in opposite direction
```

### Move Validation
```
1. Check if source hex exists and has piece
2. Check if target hex is highlighted
3. Check if piece belongs to current player
4. Execute drag-drop simulation
5. Update all game state
6. Trigger game functions
```
