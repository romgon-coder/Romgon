# AI BALANCED Scoring System - Final Version

**Date:** October 21, 2025 12:55 PM  
**Issue:** AI swinging between extremes (only rhombus → only circles)  
**Solution:** BALANCED scoring across all piece types

---

## ⚖️ The Problem with Extremes

**Attempt 1:** Rhombus got 160+ points → AI only played rhombus  
**Attempt 2:** Nerfed rhombus to ~20 points, boosted others to 300+ → AI only played circles  
**Root Cause:** Diversity bonus (+140) applied to EVERY MOVE, circles have many moves due to zone transitions

---

## ✅ BALANCED Scoring System

### Rhombus Strategy:
| Mechanic | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Distance to goal | `(20-dist) × 5` = 0-100 points |
| Row 3 bonus | +15 |
| Mobility | +12 per option |
| **Typical Total** | **80-130 points** |

### Tactical Pieces (Square/Triangle/Hexagon/Circle):
| Mechanic | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Diversity bonus | +30 base |
| Army bonus (4+ pieces) | +20 |
| **Base Total** | **+50 points** |

### Captures:
| Target | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Triangle | **180** |
| Hexagon | **170** |
| Circle | **160** |
| Square | **150** |

### Threats & Tactics:
| Action | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Threatening piece | +50 each |
| Threatening enemy rhombus | **+400** |
| Escaping danger | +300 |

### Positional Play (All Pieces):
| Bonus | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Row 3 control | +20 |
| Center distance | `(10-dist) × 3` |
| Forward progress | +10 |

## 📊 Example Scoring

### Rhombus Advancement Move:
```
Base advancement:  (20-10) × 5 = 50 points
Row 3 bonus:       15 points
Mobility (3 moves): 3 × 12 = 36 points
Center control:    20 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             121 points
```

### Square Tactical Move (with threat):
```
Diversity bonus:    30 points
Army bonus:         20 points
Threatening 1 piece: 50 points
Center control:     20 points
Forward progress:   10 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             130 points
```

### Triangle Capture:
```
Capture triangle:   180 points ⚔️
Diversity bonus:    30 points
Army bonus:         20 points
Center control:     20 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             250 points
```

### Circle with Gateway Move:
```
Diversity bonus:    30 points
Army bonus:         20 points
Threatening 1 piece: 50 points
Center control:     15 points
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             115 points
```

## 🎯 Expected AI Behavior

The AI should now show **VARIETY** in piece selection:

✅ **Rhombus:** Used strategically for advancement (120-130 points typical)  
✅ **Captures:** Highly prioritized (230-250 points)  
✅ **Tactical pieces:** Used for threats and positioning (110-150 points)  
✅ **Balanced play:** Mix of rhombus advancement and tactical piece usage

### Decision Priority:
1. **Captures** (180-250 points) - Always top priority
2. **Threatening enemy rhombus** (+400) - Critical tactical move
3. **Rhombus advancement** (80-130) - When safe and strategic
4. **Tactical positioning** (110-150) - Creating threats, controlling center
5. **Escaping danger** (+300) - Survival instinct

## 🔧 What Changed from Extremes

### From "Only Rhombus" Version:
- Rhombus advancement: ×8 → **×5** (reduced but still viable)
- Row 3 bonus: 25 → **15** (reduced but still meaningful)
- Mobility: ×20 → **×12** (reduced but still important)

### From "Only Circles" Version:
- Diversity bonus: 80 → **30** (drastically reduced)
- Army bonus: 60 → **20** (drastically reduced)
- Threat bonus: 80 → **50** (reduced)
- Captures: 300 → **180** (reduced but still high priority)
- Removed excessive logging spam

---

## 🎮 Test Results Expected

**Game Opening (Moves 1-5):**
- Mix of rhombus advancement and tactical piece positioning
- AI should move 2-3 different piece types

**Mid-Game (Moves 6-15):**
- Captures should be top priority when available
- Tactical pieces actively threaten opponent
- Rhombus advances when safe

**Late-Game (Moves 16+):**
- Rhombus push becomes higher priority
- Tactical pieces support rhombus or capture threats

## 📝 Debug Console Output

The console will still show:
```
📊 AI Move Analysis:
  Top 10 moves by piece type: {rhombus: 3, square: 2, triangle: 2, circle: 2, hexgon: 1}

🎯 Best move for each piece type:
  square: 3-1 → 3-2 | Score: 130.5 | Total: 145.2
  triangle: 2-2 → 3-3 | Score: 250.8 | Total: 270.5 (CAPTURE)
  rhombus: 3-0 → 3-1 | Score: 121.3 | Total: 135.7
  circle: 4-5 → 4-6 | Score: 115.2 | Total: 125.8

🏆 Top 5 moves overall:
  1. triangle 2-2 → 3-3 ⚔️CAPTURE | Score: 250.8, Total: 270.5
  2. square 4-1 → 3-2 | Score: 140.1, Total: 155.3
  3. rhombus 3-0 → 3-1 | Score: 121.3, Total: 135.7
  4. circle 4-5 → 5-5 | Score: 120.5, Total: 130.2
  5. hexgon 2-4 → 3-4 | Score: 118.7, Total: 125.1
```

**You should see VARIETY - not one piece type dominating!**

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

✅ Top 10 moves should show **3-4 different piece types**  
✅ Captures should always be #1 when available  
✅ Rhombus should appear but not dominate  
✅ Circles should be used tactically, not spam-moved  
✅ Game should be challenging but not impossible

**Build:** 2025-10-21T12:55:59.646Z  
**Status:** Balanced and ready for testing!

**If AI still plays only one piece type, the console logs will reveal WHY - we can then micro-adjust that specific piece type's scoring without breaking the whole system again.**
