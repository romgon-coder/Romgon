## 📊 Example Responses

### Health Check
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "ok", "responsive": true },
    "memory": { "heapUsed": "50 MB", "heapTotal": "100 MB" },
    "uptime": { "formatted": "2d 5h 23m" }
  }
}
```

### Performance Metrics
```json
{
  "queries": {
    "simple_select": { "duration_ms": 2, "status": "excellent" },
    "join_query": { "duration_ms": 8, "status": "excellent" }
  },

}
```

### Optimization Suggestion
```json
{
  "recommendations": [{

- ⚠️ Consider rate limiting for production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "Failed to load"
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl https://api.romgon.net/api/engine/health

# Check Railway deployment
# Visit: https://railway.app/project/[your-project]
```

### Backend not responding
```bash
# Restart backend (Railway auto-restarts)
# Or locally:
cd backend
npm start
```

### Data not refreshing
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket monitoring
- [ ] Historical metrics & trends
- [ ] Automated alerting system
- [ ] Database backup tools
- [ ] Query explain plans
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Automated optimization execution

## 📈 Integration with Custom Games

The system checks if custom games are properly integrated:

```javascript
// Connection check
const response = await fetch('https://api.romgon.net/api/engine/connections');
const data = await response.json();

if (data.services.customGames.status === 'connected') {
  console.log('Custom games active:', data.services.customGames.total);
  console.log('Recent creations:', data.services.customGames.recent);
}
```

## 🔗 External App Integration Check

To verify if external apps can connect:

1. Navigate to **Connections** tab
2. Check "Game Engine" status (should be 🟢 green)
3. Verify "Custom Games" integration is "active"
4. Monitor WebSocket connections for real-time features

All services showing "connected" status means:
- External apps can communicate with API
- WebSocket connections are working
- Database is accessible
- All integrations are operational

## 📞 Support

For issues:
1. Check `ENGINE_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md` for detailed docs
2. Review backend logs (Railway dashboard)
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console
4. Test API endpoints directly with curl/Postman
