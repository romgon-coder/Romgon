## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Game Engine Selector** (Step 4 - Game Metadata)
Added dropdown in Game Creator allowing users to choose between three game engines:

#### 🏰 Classic Romgon Engine
- Full combat system with attack/capture mechanics
- Fortress building and base zones
- Traditional turn-based strategy gameplay
- Stack power calculations and zone control
- **Best for:** Chess-like games, war games, tactical battles

#### 🎮 Casual/Puzzle Engine
- Move-only gameplay (no combat or capturing)
- Collectibles and goal-based objectives
- Timer and move limit challenges
- Teleport zones, traps, and puzzle mechanics
- **Best for:** Puzzles, mazes, race games, collect-athons

#### 🔀 Hybrid Engine
- Combines combat with casual mechanics
- Optional attack zones mixed with puzzle elements
- Flexible ruleset for creative game designs
- Can enable/disable combat per zone or piece type
- **Best for:** Unique game concepts, experimental designs

### 2. **Dynamic Engine Info Panel**
When user selects an engine, an info box displays:
- Engine title with emoji icon
- List of key features
- Best use cases
- Automatically updates on selection change

### 3. **🎲 Random Game Generator** (Step 5 - Test & Publish)
One-click button that generates a complete random game:

#### What it Randomizes:
- **Board Size:** 7x7 to 15x15
- **Game Engine:** Classic, Casual, or Hybrid
- **Game Name:** Random combination (e.g., "Epic Battle", "Mystic Quest")
- **Description:** Random motivational text
- **Win Condition:** Fortress, Elimination, Territory, or Capture
- **Game Mechanics:** Enables 2-4 random mechanics from:
  - Move Only, Stacking, Pickup, Trapped, Escape, Teleport, Push, One-Way, Timed
- **Board Mechanics:** Random selection of:
  - Teleport, Trap, Goal, Slide, Boost, Wrap zones
- **Pieces:** Generates 3-6 random pieces with:
  - Random colors
  - Random names (Scout, Knight, Guard, Mage, etc.)
  - Random 3x3 to 5x5 pixel patterns (60% fill rate)
  - Random count (3-6 per type)
  - Random attack power (1-3)
  - Random movement pattern (orthogonal or any)
- **Zone Assignments:** 30-50% of hexes get:
  - Random classic zones (base, inner, middle, outer)
  - 50% chance of special zones (teleport, trap, goal, etc.)

#### Generator Flow:
1. Confirms with user (prevents accidental overwrites)
2. Generates all random data
3. Initializes board with random zones
4. Updates visual board display
5. Updates zone legend preview
6. Navigates to Step 1 to show created pieces
7. Shows success notification

### 4. **Config Generation Enhanced**
Engine selection is now saved to game config:
```javascript
metadata: {
    gameEngine: 'classic' | 'casual' | 'hybrid'
}
```

This allows the game loader to select the appropriate engine when playing.
